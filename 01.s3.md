title: Simple Storage Service
---

> * Object-based storage service.
> * Provides unlimited storage.
> * Serverless stotrage in the cloud.
> * Don't worry about the file systems or disk space.

### Storage Architecture

> `Object-based` - data storage architecture that manages data as objects.    

> `file systems` - which manages data as a file and file hierarchy.  

> `block storage` - which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.

### S3 object
> Objects contain our data. They are like files.  
  Objects may consists of   
  `Key` - name of object    
  `Value` - data itself made up of sequence of bytes.    
  `VersionID` - When versioning enabled, the version of object.   
  `Metadata` - Additional information attached to the object.  

> We can store data from `0 Bytes` to `5 Terabytes` in size.   

### S3 Bucket
> Buckets hold objects.  
> Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects.   

### Storage Classes

Trade `Retrieval time, Accessibility and Durability` for `Cheaper Storage` 

> As the type goes down, the cheaper it gets.  

Type | Description
--- | ---
Standard (default) | Fast! 99.99% Availability, 11 9's Durability, Replicates across atleast three AZs
Intelligent Tiering | Uses ML to analyze our object usage and determine the appropriate storage class. Data is moved to most cost-effective access tier, without any performance impact or added overhead.  
Standard Infrequently Accessed (IA) | Still Fast! Cheaper if you access files less than a monthly. Additional retrieval fee is required. **50% less** than standard (reduced availability).  
One Zone IA | Still Fast! Objects only exist in one AZ. Availability (is 99.5%), but cheaper than Standard IA by 20% less (Reduce durability) Data could get destroyed. A retrieval fee is applied. 
Glacier | For long-term cold storage. Retrieval of data can take minutes to hours but the off is very cheap storage. 
Glacier Deep Archive | The lowest cost storage class. Data retrieval time is 12 hours.  

### Storage Class Comparision

### S3 Security

All new buckets are PRIVATE when created by default. 

Logging per request can be turned on a bucket.    
Log files are generated and saved in a different bucket.
(even a bucket in a different AWS account if desired).

Access Control is configured using `bucket policies` and `Access Control Lists (ACLs)`.
